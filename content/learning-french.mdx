Fluency in French has always been a dream of mine, for several reasons: it would open up new career opportunities, make it easier to travel, and give me access to an entire world of French literature, cinema, and culture. Ultimately, I picture myself spending time in the south of France, wandering through sunlit markets, enjoying long afternoons at cafes, exploring museums, and relaxing on the beach. But there’s one challenge—I don’t yet speak fluent French. That’s something I’ve decided to change.

While I was learning French at school, I quickly realised that these classes alone wouldn’t get me to the fluency I was hoping for. While school French helped me grasp the basics and understand some grammar rules, it doesn’t prepare you for real, fluid conversations with native speakers. Over the past few months, since finishing secondary school, I’ve committed to expanding my learning, and it’s been rewarding to see my progress. My listening skills have improved, grammar rules feel natural, and expressing myself in French is becoming more fluid each day.

The first step I took was to listen to native French speakers as much as possible. Even if you don’t understand much at first, this exposure helps your brain get accustomed to the accent, intonation, and rhythm of the language. French music has become a favourite go-to, and luckily, it’s easy to find great playlists on Spotify. Searching ‘French Music Mix’ brings up personalised playlists that make practice enjoyable.

I’ve also started replacing my usual media with French alternatives, which has been incredibly helpful. If I’m in the mood for a YouTube vlog, I find one ‘en français,’ or if I’m relaxing with Netflix, I browse for French-language shows. These small, everyday swaps make language learning feel less like a chore and more like a part of my routine.

To improve my written French, I started keeping a journal, writing a short diary entry in French every evening. It’s a simple practice, but it’s been invaluable in helping me learn vocabulary that I’d use in daily life. If I don’t know a word or grammar rule, I look it up, adding it to my repertoire in a practical way. Using AI has also been helpful for making corrections and explaining errors, which reinforces my learning.

Fluency doesn’t come without speaking, so I enrolled in online French classes a few months ago. I use Babbel, where I can take group classes with a native French speaker. I attend a class almost daily, and it’s been an amazing boost for my confidence and conversational skills. Practicing with others has shown me the value of active, real-life dialogue, something that’s essential for fluency.

While there’s still a journey ahead, I’m thrilled with the progress I’ve made and excited for where it will take me. From the basics I learned in school to the immersive steps I’ve incorporated into my daily life, every bit of practice brings me closer to that dream of conversing easily in French, experiencing France like a local, and truly diving into a new culture.
