#### What is an impossible list?
An impossible list is like a bucket list, but with a twist‚Äîrather than jotting down grand, distant goals
that you might never revisit, you create challenges that feel achievable and gradually build up. For
example, instead of starting with ‚Äúhost an exhibition for a collection of my paintings‚Äù (especially since
 I don‚Äôt know how to paint yet), my first objective is ‚Äúcomplete a painting course online.‚Äù From there,
 I‚Äôll create new goals that progressively get bigger. The concept of an impossible list was created by
 YouTuber and author Jade Bowler, whose [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWzwrIpci7k) I highly recommend for inspiration.

#### My impossible list
There are two main reasons I‚Äôm sharing my list publicly. First, I hope to inspire you to create your own,
 as this approach has genuinely helped me achieve my goals. For instance, two years ago, one of my goals
 was to learn how to drive. My first step was to pass my theory test, which I added to my list. Once I
 accomplished that, I moved on to taking 12 driving lessons, and eventually, to pass my test (which I did!).
 The second reason I‚Äôm sharing my list is a bit more selfish‚ÄîI want to increase my chances of actually
 achieving these goals. Studies show that sharing a goal with others makes you more likely to achieve it
 because you‚Äôre now accountable to those who know about it. So, thanks for being my accountability partner!
  If you notice items on my list not getting ticked off, feel free to nag me.

strongly encourage you to create your own list, as it will not only help you achieve more but
