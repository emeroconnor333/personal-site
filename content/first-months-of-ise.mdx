It’s been two months since I started the Immersive Software Engineering (ISE) course at the University of Limerick, and I’ve already learned so much. ISE is a new and exciting course that combines learning in the classroom with real-world experience. Even though it’s early days, I can see how this approach will be really useful for my future career. Here’s a bit about what we’ve been up to so far.

### What is ISE?
ISE is a software engineering course with a bit of a twist. Instead of just sitting listening to lectures all day, we’ll spend a lot of our time doing practical work and projects. One of the most exciting parts of the course is the five residencies, two-month work placements at leading tech companies like Stripe, Intercom, and AWS. These placements let us try out different areas of software engineering and gain real experience before we even graduate. I think this is incredibly beneficial because it helps you figure out what you like and what you’re good at early on.

### The First Week: Meeting the Residency Partners
The program kicked off with a day dedicated to introducing our residency partners. Representatives from the companies came in to share what they do, the problems they solve, and what it’s like to work in their teams. It was inspiring to hear about their work and the opportunities we’ll have to contribute to impactful projects. This day alone motivated me to give my best effort in the course.

Residency placements are determined based on academic performance, with students listing their preferences and the highest performers getting priority for interviews. This system encourages us to work hard while giving everyone a fair shot at their dream placement.

### What We’ve Learned So Far
Over the past two months, we’ve covered a lot of topics. Here are some of the main ones:
- **Java**: We’ve been learning Java, which was new to me but not too difficult to pick up since I already had a bit of experience with Python and JavaScript.
- **Computer Organization and Architecture**: This module has been fascinating. It’s incredible to learn about how computers work from the ground up, including the hardware and low-level processes that make software possible.
- **IGNITE Minor**: IGNITE has been all about getting excited about a career in tech. Each week, we explored a different emerging technology, from natural language processing to virtual reality. These sessions have shown me just how many opportunities exist in software engineering.
- **Careers Minor**: This module has focused on professional skills, helping us refine our CVs, practice interviews, and learn how to succeed in team-based environments. It’s been invaluable for preparing us for our future residencies and beyond.

## Group Projects
Collaboration has been a major part of the course so far. We’ve completed several group projects, which have given me the opportunity to work closely with my classmates. These projects have been a great way to learn from others, improve teamwork skills, and tackle challenges together. I’ve really enjoyed the process of brainstorming, problem-solving, and creating solutions as part of a team.

## Self-Directed Learning
ISE places a strong emphasis on self-directed learning, with dedicated hours in our timetable to explore areas of interest. I’ve been using this time to dive deeper into web development, specifically learning React as there are a few personal project ideas I’m excited to build.

## A Supportive Community
One of the things I love about ISE is the sense of community. All of our lectures take place in the same building, which creates a close-knit environment. The older students have been incredibly helpful, offering advice on coursework, residency experiences, and how to navigate the challenges of the program. The staff are equally supportive, always encouraging us to explore and ask questions.

## Looking Ahead
These first two months have been everything I hoped for and more. I’ve already learned so much and feel more confident about my future in software engineering. With residencies on the horizon and countless opportunities to grow, I’m excited for what’s next.

If you’re in secondary school and considering ISE, I’d highly recommend it. It’s a program that truly prepares you for the real world, combining innovative learning with practical experience. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to chat about the course!
