Our arrival in Amsterdam was nothing short of magical. The city welcomed my mom and I with its picturesque canals and beautifully decorated old buildings that seemed to tell stories of centuries past. We went on a canal boat tour where we learned about the rich history and architecture of this charming city. It was a perfect backdrop for my current read, The Miniaturist, which is set in the Golden Age of Amsterdam- seeing the real-life setting brought the story to life in a way that words alone never could.

Our next stop was Tony’s Chocolonely shop, an experience that felt like stepping into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The store was vibrant, overflowing with unique chocolate flavours.  We ended the day with a cosy Italian dinner by the canal, enjoying the serene evening atmosphere. An early night called for a little self-care: I spent the evening in the hotel room sketching the beautiful boathouses and journaling my thoughts in my notebook.

The next morning, we set off for the city park, the Vondelpark, but not before spending time in a bookshop, as both my mom and I are big book-lovers. With a few new books in hand, we went to a café to read for a while.

The Vondelpark was everything I imagined: winding paths shaded by trees, full of colourful flowers, with a stunning water fountain. It was the perfect spot to relax and enjoy the warm summer air. We stopped by Joe & the Juice afterward, where I got a smoothie. The place was lively and filled with mothers and daughters just like us.

A significant moment came when my Leaving Cert results came out while we were browsing in Søstrene Grene, and I learned that I had gotten 625 points. It felt surreal, and it took a while for the reality to sink in. To celebrate, we visited the Ice Bar, where the walls, glasses and sculptures were made of ice, an experience that made this day even more unforgettable.

Amsterdam for me was a blend of joy, calm, and little moments that make a trip special. From canal tours and tulip markets to unexpected milestones, this trip has left me with memories to last a lifetime.
