Deciding what to study in college was not a straightforward choice for me. I’ve always found joy in creativity and making art, yet I’ve also been really interested in maths and science. For the longest time, I was certain I would study pure physics. It seemed like a solid path that aligned with my interests in problem solving and science, and it offered clearer job prospects compared to fields like fashion design or fine art. However, deep down, I struggled with the idea of leaving behind my creative passions.

Everything changed when I had a conversation with my sister’s boss. He had completed the same university course in physics I was considering and offered insights that would shift my perspective entirely. During our discussion, he mentioned computer science—a field I had never considered before, partly because I didn’t know anyone in my family or close circles who worked in it. This conversation made me think: could software engineering be the perfect blend of creativity and problem solving that I was looking for?

After this, I decided to explore coding to see if it resonated with me. I started with Python, a language known for its simplicity and readability—a choice I would recommend to any beginner. To my surprise, I found coding not just engaging but really satisfying. There was something uniquely rewarding about creating a project from scratch and watching it come to life, knowing that I had built it with my own logic and ideas.

As I delved deeper, I learned how to make websites using HTML and style them with CSS. This step was a game-changer; it allowed me to combine my artistic side with technical skills. I soon found myself loving the process of designing and structuring web pages. One of my most memorable projects was creating [a website for my sister](https://emeroconnor333.github.io/EmpowerHer/index.html), who was considering setting up in-person wellness workshops. It was an opportunity to bring my skills together—understanding her vision, designing an appealing interface, and ensuring the site functioned smoothly. The sense of accomplishment from building something meaningful for someone else was unmatched.

This journey taught me that software engineering wasn’t just a technical field; it was a creative one as well. It provided a way for me to use my analytical abilities while nurturing my passion for design and innovation. The combination of coding and creativity made me realise that software engineering was exactly what I had been searching for—a discipline where I could build, solve, and design all at once.

Looking back, the decision to shift from pure sciences to software engineering was filled with uncertainty, but it was the best choice I could have made. The skills I’ve developed so far and the projects I’ve worked on have reinforced that this is where my interests and strengths intersect. To anyone who, like me, is torn between different passions—know that there’s often a path that allows you to merge them. For me, software engineering turned out to be that path, bridging creativity and logical problem solving in ways I hadn’t thought possible.
