The second block of my course (November to December) was both challenging and rewarding. With modules like Maths for Computer Science, Java, and Ideation and Innovation, this block offered a lot of learning opportunities that pushed me to grow academically and creatively.

Maths for Computer Science stood out to me. While initially challenging, it was really rewarding when I put in the effort to grasp the concepts.

In Java, I built on my knowledge from the first block, delving into more advanced concepts. It was exciting to apply my existing skills to new challenges and see tangible progress in my programming abilities.

Ideation and Innovation brought an entirely different perspective to the table. We learned about startups, from brainstorming creative ideas to validating markets, and even participated in a hackathon run by the NDRC. This hands-on experience was invaluable, offering insight into the dynamic world of startups and innovation.

A unique aspect of Ideation and Innovation was the time set aside each week for a personal project. I worked on a project called Plate Planner, a website designed to help users with meal planning and finding recipes. With the guidance of our lecturer, Josh McGiff, I made significant progress on the project and gained valuable feedback throughout the process.

The highlight of the block was our group project: creating a calculator. My team and I went all out,  over-engineering it to include root-finding algorithms, differentiation, matrices, complex numbers and more. The collaboration and problem-solving involved made it an unforgettable experience—and a great learning opportunity.

This block was packed with challenges, creativity, and teamwork. It strengthened my interest in software engineering and left me looking forward to what’s ahead in the course.
